## Solution
𝟏) 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐈𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧
- Versify was conceived as a Christ-centered social media and community blogging platform, driven by my passion to provide a nurturing space for Christians to express themselves. This personal project marked my initial foray into entrepreneurship at the age of 17, mentored by my father, and fueled by a vision to go against academic norms in 2021.

𝟐) 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬
- During this transformative period spanning 9 months, I delved into various facets of business development, branding, project management, and mobile app development. Despite limited prior knowledge, I embraced the challenge with enthusiasm, learning invaluable lessons along the way.

𝟑) 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭 & 𝐌𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐚
- The flagship component of this venture was the Versify Mobile App, which reached a milestone of 70% completion. Concurrently, I actively engaged in developing the startup and fostering social media presence.

𝟒) 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧
- Regrettably, the startup did not launch due to personal circumstances, leading to a pause in the project's progression. Now, I am leveraging this experience to glean insights from industrial projects and further refine my skills and knowledge.
